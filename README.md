# Bleep

**Bleep** is a free, NFC-based iOS app that helps you stay off your phone with a simple tap. Inspired by devices like Brickd, Bleep offers a lightweight and low-cost alternative to boost focus and reduce screen time â€” all built with Swift.

## ðŸ§  Motivation

I saw Brickd on Instagram â€” a device that helps you stay focused by physically locking your phone. I liked the idea, but not the $60 price tag. So I rebuilt it as a mobile app â€” for 50 cents.

Bleep is just a side project I wanted to build and share.
